# Advent of Code 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming challenge. Each year, Advent of Code provides a fun and challenging set of puzzles for the 25 days leading up to Christmas.

## 📂 Directory Structure

The solutions are organized by programming language and year, with each day having its own subdirectory.

### Language Details

- **Go (Golang):** Solutions can be found in the `golang` directory.
- **TypeScript:** Solutions can be found in the `typescript` directory.

Each day's directory typically includes:
- The solution code for the day.
- Input files (if applicable).
- Any additional notes or files required for the solution.
